Good day

I created this mini project as I wanted to help a family member to convert images to svg. 
Looking online, I found this website which gave me the solution.

As per the website, please take note of this: 

"When performing pixel vector conversion, the picture mode only supports RGB three-color mode. Take png as an example. If it is a full-color 24-bit image, it is supported, but an 8-bit png image Obviously it cannot be converted because its picture mode is P mode. In this case, before using python script to convert the picture, it is recommended to use photoshop to perform a simple mode conversion on the picture."

So please take a look at their website if you need more assistance with this.
